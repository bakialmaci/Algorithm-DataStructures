Data types in C++ is mainly divided into three types:

1-Primitive Data Types: These data types are built-in or predefined data types and can be used directly by the user to declare variables. example: int, char , float, bool etc. Primitive data types available in C++ are:

Integer(Integers typically requires 4 bytes of memory)
Character(Characters typically requires 1 byte of memory)
Boolean
Floating(Float variables typically requires 4 byte of memory)
Double Floating(Float variables typically requires 8 byte of memory)
Valueless or Void
Wide Character

2-Derived Data Types: The data-types that are derived from the primitive or built-in datatypes are referred to as Derived Data Types. These can be of four types namely:
Function
Array
Pointer
Reference

3-Abstract or User-Defined Data Types: These data types are defined by user itself. Like, defining a class in C++ or a structure. C++ provides the following user-defined datatypes:
Class
Structure
Union
Enumeration
Typedef defined DataType
